<h1>What is this site about?</h1>
<p>This site is all about blockchain technology.</p>
Blockchain technology stands for freedom. The freedom to do whatever you want with your hard-earned money. The state can't take half of it from you. I'm not saying taxes are wrong. The state has the responsibility to take care of its citizens. However, there are always huge tax wastes that could be avoided.

Blockchain technology is not just for Bitcoin, however. Bitcoin only runs on a blockchain. The blockchain makes it possible to transmit information in a tamper-proof manner using a decentralized database shared by many participants, so that copies are excluded.
